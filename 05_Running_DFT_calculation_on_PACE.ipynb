    "To submit a job to the PBS system, you have to use the **qsub** command. We usually call this file run.sh for convenience. The command for submiiting the job will be **qsub run.sh**. When you do this, you are essentially handing the file to the PBS queuing system which will scan the file for the blocks containing #PBS that specify the resources you are requesting for the job. Each line in this file starting with #PBS specifies something different. The line with tag *-l* are requesting certain resources (nodes and processors per node). You can request the resources based on requirement of your calculations. In this example script, we are requesting for 1 node and 8 processors per node. The next line (#PBS -l pmem=3GB) specifies the memory you request per processor. Here it is 3 GB. Hence the total memory we request for is 24 GB. For Phoenix cluster, the default queue is *inferno* where the jobs are run. -N is the name you want to give the job, -o and -e are the filenames where the outputs and errors will be printed respectively. You can run *pace-whoami* check the maximum resources available for a particular queue. \n",

The next line with change directory (cd) command with an alias for current working directory (PBS_O_WORKDIR) changes to the correct folder. More information about PBS script and submission of jobs on PACE can be found in this [link](https://pace.gatech.edu/pace-user-documentation). "

For setting up a DFT calculation, we first need to build the chemical system whose properties we want to calculate. In the example given, the object is a water molecule. By building the system, we are essentially specifying its atomic positions. Since it is a water molecule, it has to be put in a isolated box with 10 Angstrom vacuum in all three directions so that electron density of the molecule doesn't overlap with that of its images. The molecule should be located at the center of the box. We can verify this by using ASE's visualize method as we learnt in the previous lectures. "
